    "## 4.1. Analyze in parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting aspect of ome.zarr is that it is now fairly easy to run analysis in parallel on a subset of a \"remote Image\". In this case, we perform a segmentation on each 2D-plane in parallel using Dask.\n",
    "\n",
    "The guide [Analyze data stored in a public S3 repository in parallel](https://omero-guides.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/docs/analyze_dask_s3.html) describes how to install the required dependencies, how to load the image and analyze the data.\n",
